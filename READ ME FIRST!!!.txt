Instructions

Step 1:
Open the nsprcl project and compile the Registry Control into the Release folder

Step 2:
Open the prjMruSearch project

If the active x control is not found when the project loads, go to Project -> References and add the nsprcl.dll compiled in
the Release folder.

Step 3:
I have also included a sample project that demonstrates the use of the registry controls as an inline class module, 
and gives an example of how a registry cleaner works..

Have fun!
